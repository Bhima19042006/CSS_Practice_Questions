        <h1>Morning in the City</h1>
        <p>The morning air carried a quiet energy as the city slowly woke up. Shops lifted their shutters one by one, tea vendors poured steaming cups for early customers, and the roads began to fill with soft, steady movement. Somewhere between the sound of distant horns and chirping birds, the day found its rhythm, reminding everyone that even ordinary moments have a calm beauty when noticed closely.</p>
